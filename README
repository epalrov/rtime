description:    Example of RPC client/server applications.

                Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a powerful technique for
                constructing distributed, client/server based applications.
                This example exploits how to use the Sun RPC (described in the 
                RFC1831, and sometimes called ONC RPC) to convert local
                procedures to remote procedures so that the called procedure
                need not exist in the same address space as the calling
                procedure. The two processes may be on the same system, or they
                may be on different systems with a network connecting them.
                This example implements all the following IPC mechanisms:
                 - unix socket (local)
                 - udp socket (network)
                 - tcp socket (network)
